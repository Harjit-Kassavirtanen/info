- Issues with pushing to 'invosy_pre_dev_est' because of error 'git: your configuration specifies to merge with the ref'
- Exploring the issue, found that the remote tracked branch was defferent from local branch
- local branch is invosy_pre_dev_est, remote tracking branch is dev_est
- 'git branch -r' lists remote branches, 'git branch -v -a'

17/01/2024
- Latest 'pre_dev' branch is merged into 'dev' for Invosy Estonia after successfull publish to production
